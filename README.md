# SimpleTextEditor

This is a very simple text editor made in C# with the gui made using avalonia

## How to run

Download the release, unzip it and cd to the extracted folder, and run "dotnet SimpleTextEditor.dll" in the cli, make sure you have dotnet installed

note:I don't know yet that the build is working on windows or macos or not



## Features

It only supports reading and  writing from one file for now, can load and save text

## what's coming on next

It needs a LOT  of changes to add making multiple files etc, 
that a normal text editor will do, that stuff is underway but progress will be slow since I have exams and school
